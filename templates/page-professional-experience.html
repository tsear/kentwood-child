                <p>I worked under John Lant, proprietor of Write Act Repertory, an off-Broadway production house. Over the two & a half years I worked with John, we worked on countless projects, doing some extremely cool things, as well as some extremely <strong><em>un-glamourous</em></strong> things.</p>
                <p>The role involved the technical management of the installation & tear-down of shows as they enter/exit venues in Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan. Coordination starts in pre-production: Source equipment & skilled labor for lighting, audio, special effects, scene construction, set dressing, musical equipment, etc... totaling in hundreds of thousands of dollars in equipment, alone.</p>
                <p>This role introduced me to logistical strategy & management in a way that truly revolutionized my outlook on professional life, & life as an individual.</p>
